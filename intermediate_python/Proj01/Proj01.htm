<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments</strong>.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj01 Copyright 2021 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires that you <a name="understand">understand</a>:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>Blockquotes</li>
	<li>Headers</li>
	<li>Links to internal anchors</li>
	<li>Inline code</li>



</ul>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
	  <p>The zip file that you download for this assignment will contain a file 
	  named Proj01Output.html. Open that file in your browser and examine it 
	  very carefully.</p>
		<p>Create a Jupyter Notebook named Proj01YourName.ipynb which, when 
		downloaded as an HTML file, matches the file 
		named Proj01Output.html. Match the instructional text along with the 
		results of those instructions.</p>
	  <p>Encapsulate a copy of your HTML output file and a copy of the ipynb file in a 
	  zip file and submit the zip file via Blackboard.</p>
	  <p>As a result of the differing behavior of different versions of Jupyter 
	  Notebook, you may not be able to match the cosmetic aspects of the file 
	  named Proj01Output.html in every detail. For example, the text need not be blue and need 
	  not be underlined. 
	  However, the headers must be anchors to the links at the top of the page 
	  and the links at the top must be links to 
	  the headers.</p>
	  <p>Don't overlook the requirement to create a link to an external website 
	  and the requirement to create a link to an internal anchor.</p>
	  <p>Also don't overlook the requirement to match the text under the header 
	  titled <strong>Escape characters and inline monospace</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your name appears in the certification as indicated.</p>
