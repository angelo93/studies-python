<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>

    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj08, Copyright 2018 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires that you understand the frequency 
resolution of the SciPy FFT.</p>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Create a Jupyter Notebook named Proj08YourName.ipynb that begins by 
		displaying the following certification.</p>
	  <p>I certify that this project is my own work and is not the work of 
	  others. I agree not to share my solution with others. - Print your name 
	  here.</p>
	  <p>Add the following code to your notebook.</p>
<pre>
freq = 500 #cycles per second (Hz)
period = 1/freq #seconds per sample

#Create 4 samples for each cycle of the sinusoidal pulse
time_step = period/4 #sampling interval

#Create a time base sufficient to describe 20 cycles of the
# sinusoid with an interval of time_step.
time_vec = np.arange(0, 20*period,time_step)

#Create the sinusoid
sigA = (np.sin(2 * np.pi * time_vec / period))

#Force the first 50% of the sinusoid to have a value of zero leaving
#approximately 9.5 cycles of the sinusoid intact.
for i in range(int(0.50*sigA.size)):
    sigA[i] = 0
</pre>

	  <p>This code will create a sinusoidal pulse 10 cycles in length embedded 
	  in a time series twice that long as shown in the following image. Display 
	  the image in your notebook.</p>
	  <p>
	  <img alt="Missing image" height="288" src="Proj08YourNameA.jpg" width="432"></p>
	  <p>Note that this signal is referred to by the variable named sigA.</p>
	  <p>Compute and plot the amplitude spectrum of sigA producing the following 
	  image in your notebook.</p>
	  <p>
	  <img alt="Missing image" height="288" src="Proj08YourNameB.jpg" width="432"></p>
	  <p>Write code similar to that shown above to create a new signal referred 
	  to by a variable named sigB. Plot that signal in your notebook.</p>
	  <p>Compute and plot the amplitude spectrum of sigB producing the following 
	  image in your notebook.</p>
	  <p>
	  <img alt="Missing image" height="288" src="Proj08YourNameD.jpg" width="432"></p>
	  <p>Also cause your code to write each of the four images into output files 
	  named:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Proj08YourNameA.jpg</li>
		  <li>Proj08YourNameB.jpg</li>
		  <li>Proj08YourNameC.jpg</li>
		  <li>Proj08YourNameD.jpg</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Variations among different versions of Jupyter Notebook may result in 
	  cosmetic formatting differences in the plots as compared to those shown 
	  above. That will be acceptable so long as the curves are correct.</p>
	  <p>Download an HTML version of your notebook named Proj08YourName.html.

</p>
	  <p>Encapsulate a copy of the HTML file, a copy of the ipynb file, and a 
	  copy of each of the 
	  four image files in a zip file and submit the zip file via Blackboard.

</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your actual name appears in the certification, in each of the images, and in the file names as indicated.</p>
