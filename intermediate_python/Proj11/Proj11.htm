<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>

<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj11 Copyright 2022 R.G.Baldwin</p>
	  <p>Among other things, this project requires you to </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Read a csv file 
	  containing a large amount of stock market data.</li>
		  <li>Perform specific operations on the High, Low, Open, and Close values.</li>
		  <li>Display the modified data in tables and graphs.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
	  <p>The zip file that you downloaded contains a file named Stock01.csv. It 
	  also contains a file named Proj11YourName.html.</p>
	  <p>Create a Jupyter notebook named Proj11YourName.ipynb where YourName is 
	  actually your own name. 
	  Store the file named Stock01.csv in the same folder as the file named 
	  Proj11YourName.ipynb.</p>
	  <p>Your notebook must begin by displaying the following certification 
	  (without the quotes).</p>
	  <p>"I certify that this project is my own work and is not the work of others. I agree not to share my solution with others. - Print your name here."</p>
	  <p>Then your notebook must replicate the contents of the given file named 
	  Proj11YourName.html. Note that the file named Proj11YourName.html was 
	  modified to hide the code that you must insert into your ipynb file in 
	  order to produce the required tables and graphs.</p>
	  <p>The format of the 
	  tables may be different provided that they display matching data.</p>
	  <p>Variations among different versions of Jupyter Notebook may result in 
	  cosmetic formatting differences in the graphs That will be acceptable so 
	  long as the curves, the labels, and the legends are correct.</p>
	  <p>
	  Download an HTML version of your notebook named Proj11YourName.html where 
	  YourName is your actual name.</p>
	  <p>Encapsulate a copy of the HTML file, a copy of the ipynb file, and a 
	  copy of the file named Stock01.csv in a 
	  zip file and submit the zip file via Blackboard.</p>
	  <p>Be sure that your actual name appears in the certification and in the file names as indicated.</p>
