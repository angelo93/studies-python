IDEA: Program to rename file extensions and organize by file extension or by filename.

OUTLINE: Boot Up
            1. Work in current directory (where the script was ran)
            2. Enter specific directory
         Main Menu
            1. Rename file extensions (IN: old extension, IN: new extension)
            2. Organize by file extension
                RESULT: 
                    root_path\TXT
                        -> file1.txt
                        -> file2.txt
                        -> fileN.txt
            3. Organize by filename
                RESULT: 
                    root_path\FileA
                        -> filea.png
                        -> fileA.txt
                        -> FileA.py
            4. Organize into alphabetical folders. (Option for both of the functions above)
                RESULT: 
                    root_path\F\FileA
                        -> filea.png
                        -> fileA.txt
                        -> FileA.py
            5. Delete empty directories (Cleans up directory for ease of use)
            6. Change working directory (IN: New directory)
            7. Exit
